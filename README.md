# codechef-downloader
 A script to download solutions from any user in CodeChef.

This program takes a username and finds full solved sections by it, allowing you to download any one section and store it in the Downloads folder which needs to be created before running the program.

Since it extracts code from the plaintext section of the solution, the program might download faulty code which will be fixed in some time.

Execute the program by running `python main.py`
Requires requests, bs4, os and re packages along with Python3 or higher.
